# Expanding on the Grafana Dashboard for Monitoring a Data Processing Pipeline

This guide provides ideas of additional metrics that may be useful to include on your dashboard in this scernerio.

Given the described architecture involving API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and a third-party recommendations ML model, here are examples of things you might monitor using dashboards:

1. **API Gateway:**
   - **Request Count:** Number of API calls made to your recommendations service.
   - **Latency:** Time taken to process and respond to a request.
   - **4XX Errors:** Client side errors like missing authentication tokens.
   - **5XX Errors:** Server side errors indicating issues in your Lambda function or connectivity.

2. **Lambda:**
   - **Invocation Count:** Total number of times the Lambda function is invoked.
   - **Duration:** Execution time of your Lambda function.
   - **Error Count:** Number of failed executions.
   - **Concurrent Executions:** Number of invocations running simultaneously.

3. **DynamoDB:**
   - **Read/Write Capacity Units:** Number of read and write operations per second.
   - **Provisioned Throughput Consumption:** Percentage of provisioned throughput consumed.
   - **Throttled Requests:** Number of requests exceeding the provisioned throughput.
   - **Latency:** Time taken for read and write operations.

4. **Third-party Recommendations ML Model:**
   - **Request Count:** Number of calls made to the ML model.
   - **Latency:** Time taken by the ML model to respond.
   - **Error Count:** Number of failed requests or errors during interaction.
   - **Accuracy and Performance Metrics:** Depending on available metrics, monitor the accuracy and performance of the recommendation model.

5. **General Monitoring:**
   - **Cost:** AWS costs associated with running the service.
   - **Network Traffic:** Amount of incoming and outgoing network traffic.
   - **CPU/Memory Usage:** For services where applicable, like Lambda.
   - **User Engagement Metrics:** How users are interacting with the recommendations provided.
